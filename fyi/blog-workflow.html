<p class="subtitle">Simple and clean is the way it should be</p>

<p>One of my main objectives when building my personal website was to make sure the workflow for posting new articles would be as easy as possible. At the same time, I also wanted to do this without relying on some third-party CMS, or worse yet, building one on my own.</p>

<p>What I decided on was a really simple mix of HTML and Markdown, supported by Middleman’s blog extension. That’s how this and the rest of the articles I’ve posted got made. The workflow looks like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Draft and complete the article in <a href="https://bear.app">Bear</a> (my note-taking app)</li>
  <li>Generate a new article in my Middleman project with <code>middleman article TITLE</code></li>
  <li>Fill in the front-matter for title, tags, date, slug</li>
  <li>Use the ‘Copy As Markdown’ option in Bear</li>
  <li>Copy the MD article into my project</li>
  <li>Preview then publish!</li>
</ol>

<p>This affords me a lot of flexibility despite the lack of CMS. For instance, if I want to publish a blog post featuring some media I haven’t used in previous articles, I can just deal with the styling when I have to. And because all articles use the article_layout which all use the same stylesheet, I’ll have that for the next instance I use that type of media.</p>

<p>I also get all the nice little benefits of Middleman’s blog extension, namely the customizable front-matter, the ability to ‘unpublish’ an article without deleting it, all without relying on a chunky CMS. This way I can focus on the content, be 100% in control of the style and create new articles with ease.</p>

<p>There are so many ways to approach making a blog and I’m sure there are some drawbacks to this way, but this way really seems to make sense to me and has been a snap so far!</p>

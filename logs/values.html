    Different platforms encourage different types of messaging. My thoughts on balancing my desire to make good content with my values.
  </p>
</div>

<p>People have different ways of coping with the virtual necessity to have a presence on platforms they dislike: some go with the flow and try their hand at becoming fluent in a given platform; some just participate out of necessity; some try to test the mold and shape the platform to their own style; and others just abstain from participating. The latter has been my strategy the past few years.</p>

<p>There’s nothing interesting about abstention. Some people hold a certain pride about <strong>not</strong> being on a platform; my feeling isn’t so much pride as it is exhaustion. I’ve been online most of my life and I’ve been performing various online identities, all under my own name.</p>

<p>The things I want to write about or share often don’t fit neatly into the molds of the big platforms, and I chafe at the <strong>need</strong> for these thoughts to turn into a conversation in the comments section. Sometimes I just need to spill my thoughts without regard for social media currency, such as likes or comments.</p>

<p>My first post on this site was about how to implement Tencent’s “message security check” - aka, censorship – API for your WeChat miniprogram. My initial thought was to share some useful knowledge about using Tencent’s API, which don’t have great English documentation. I thought it might be a good way to start presenting myself as an authority on WeChat mini programs, which don’t have too many non-Chinese experts. But as I wrote that post I realized I also wanted to acknowledge there are very specific reasons I decided to do it, and about my own moral qualms. On LinkedIn,  your knowledge is valuable, but what about your moral qualms? You’ll rarely see it, and for very practical reasons: bringing up any of the moral complexities of doing business in China runs counter to many individuals’ brands or businesses, which relies on shifting focus away from those topics. Anything short of unerring enthusiasm feels verboten on LinkedIn, even when it’s about something as ominous as surveillance tech.</p>

<p>With this site, I hope not to just be a cheerleader for myself and my accomplishments but also save some space to reflect on the work I’m doing. For now, I just want to loosely establish what I want to use this space for. I want it to be a place to share my values, to share things that make me excited. I don’t want it to be a <strong>purely</strong> professional space, sanitized of any personality. I don’t want to posture. I just want people to know where I come from.</p>
